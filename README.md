Algorithms for Preprocessing Small Samples in Machine Learning Problems

In this paper, we propose an improvement in algorithms for solving classical ma-chine learning problems with insufficient amounts of initial data in problems of processing small data samples, which is relevant when processing test results, the volume of which is limited due to the high cost or large time costs of each test - in such areas as medicine, biology, aviation and mechanical engineering. The idea of the new proposed technique is to improve existing methods for improving the quality of classical machine learning algorithms by using a method that involves transforming the original data to increase the sample size by combining small samples based on rank statistical criteria. The implementation of the proposed ap-proach is based on the use of a method for calculating the exact distributions of rank nonparametric criteria for testing statistical hypotheses based on the permu-tation algorithm with repetitions, the implementation of which requires numerous repetitions of possible permutations of ranks. To implement this approach, sever-al programs have been developed using advanced software development tools, as a result of which the most effective tool for solving the problem was chosen as a result of the comparison.
